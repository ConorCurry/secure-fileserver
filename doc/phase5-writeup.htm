      <h2>Overview</h2>
<!-- BEGIN CHANGES HERE -->

<p>In this section, broadly overview your threat model, attacks, and
countermeasures.</p>

<!-- END CHANGES HERE -->
    </section>
    <section id="threatmodel">
      <h2>Threat Model</h2>
<!-- BEGIN CHANGES HERE -->

<p>Define a threat model within which your implementation is subject to attack.
You may re-use a threat model from another phase of the project, or you may
define a new threat model (e.g., What if we were worried about more than just
the file leakage from a file server? What if the group server was mostly
trusted, but the password file or other state was somehow leaked? What about the
possibility of DoS or DDoS attacks?). This threat model should be written up in
the same format as the threat models that you were given for Phases P3 and P4 of
the project.</p>

<!-- END CHANGES HERE -->
    </section>
    <section id="attack">
      <h2>Attacks</h2>
<!-- BEGIN CHANGES HERE -->

<p>Write a clear and concise description of the attacks against your
implementation. Describe each step of the attack, and include protocol diagrams
to clarify your discussion as needed. Provide evidence for why these attacks are
possible, and why they represent a threat against your system.</p>

<p>If your group implemented programs to demonstrate your attacks, discuss these
programs here.</p>

<!-- END CHANGES HERE -->
    </section>
    <section id="countermeasure">
      <h2>Countermeasures</h2>
<!-- BEGIN CHANGES HERE -->

<p>Write a clear and concise description of the mechanism that your group
proposes to address each attack from the previous section. Follow the format
described in Phases P3 and P4 of the project: describe the mechanism in detail
(including protocol diagrams as needed) and provide justification for why your
proposed mechanism is sufficient for addressing the threat that you have
discovered.</p>

<!-- END CHANGES HERE -->
    </section>
    <section id="discussion">
      <h2>Discussion</h2>
<!-- BEGIN CHANGES HERE -->

<p>Conclude with a paragraph or two discussing your threat model and
countermeasure mechanisms. How realistic is your threat model for a real-life
file sharing system? Comment on the design process that your group followed. Did
you discuss other ideas that didn’t pan out before settling on the
above-documented approach? Did you design attacks that you were unable to
mitigate, or that you think are impossible to mitigate? Use this space to show
off your hard work!</p>

<p>Finally, spend a paragraph discussing the interplay between the
countermeasures for your proposed attacks and your techniques for mitigating
threats T1–T7 from Phases P3 and P4 of the project. Did you have to design your
countermeasures in a particular way so as not to re-introduce these older
threats?</p>

<p>If your group implemented the countermeasures or did any extra credit, please
discuss these additional contributions in this section, as well.</p>
