FileSharing Usage Information

USAGE:
 To start Group Server: java -cp .:/{Whatever path before that}/cs1653-project-clc231-yic66/resources/bcprov-jdk15on-154.jar RunGroupServer [(optional) port number]
 When the group server is first started, there are no users or groups. Since 
 there must be an administer of the system, the user is prompted via the console
 to enter a username, and create the passwords for his/her account and group server. This name becomes the first user and is a member of the  ADMIN group.  Also, no groups exist.  The group server will by default
 run on port 8765, but a custom port can be passed as the first command line
 argument. If it's not the first time to start the server, it's required to put the server's password.


 To start the File Server: java -cp .:/{Whatever path before that}/cs1653-project-clc231-yic66/resources/bcprov-jdk15on-154.jar RunFileServer [(optional) port number]
 The file server will create a shared_files inside the working directory if one does not exist. The file server is now online. The password of the file server needs to be created, if it does not exist. If it's not the first time to start the server, it's required to put the server's password. The file server will by default
 run on port 4321, but a custom port can be passed as the first command line argument.

 To reset the File server completely, delete FileList.bin and the shared_files 
 directory.
 To reset the Group Server, delete UserList.bin.
 
 Note that this implementation supports server side directories.

 To run the client application:java -cp .:/{Whatever path before that}/cs1653-project-clc231-yic66/resources/bcprov-jdk15on-154.jar ClientApp
 This client will connect to the group server by specifying the name and also the port number consistent with the one for the group server.
 The username will be asked for log in. If the user is in the system, the user needs to put in his/her password to start the process of authenticaion. If the user is not in the system, he/she will be asked to create a password for future use. The information of key pairs will be recorded, and that user will be forced to log out.
 The user will be shown a list of their groups and also choose the one they would like to work on.
 The main menu will appear, and a list of operations for group server will be shown.
 If the user would like to work on file server as well, the user can connect via the corresponding option.
 And the submenu of the file server will be shown.
 If the user would like to double check their groups, they can list groups anytime. And also, they can change the working group whenever they like.
 The user will exit the application if they would like to.
