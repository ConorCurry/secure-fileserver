FileSharing Usage Information

USAGE:
 To start Group Server: java RunGroupServer [(optional) port number]
 When the group server is first started, there are no users or groups. Since 
 there must be an administer of the system, the user is prompted via the console
 to enter a username. This name becomes the first user and is a member of the
 ADMIN group.  Also, no groups exist.  The group server will by default
 run on port 8765, but a custom port can be passed as the first command line
 argument.

 To start clients for Group Server, java GroupClientApp [(optional) port number]
 If you put a port number when you start your Group Server, then it is necessary to 
 put the same port number you put for your server. Otherwise, the port number is the  
 default port number set in the code. 

 Operations and How to evoke:
 1. Connect(): if you run the GroupClientApp, the connection will be opened automatically.

 2. getToken(): once you open the client, the application will ask for your username and crate a token for you.

 If you do not get a valid option, you cannot continue. The connection will be interrupted, and the application will be shut down. Once you have the token, you are able to do the following operations if you put the corresponding number of the menu shown:

 3. createUser(): if you press 1, and you are the member of “ADMIN”, you can create a new user by inputting the username for that user. Otherwise, you will fail to do so and return to the main menu.

 4. deleteUser(): if you press 2, and you are the member of “ADMIN”, you can delete a user by inputting the username for that user. Otherwise, you will fail to do so and return to the main menu.

 5. createGroup(): if you press 3, you are able to create a new group by inputting the name of your group. You will fail to do so if the group already exists.

 6. deleteGroup(): if you press 4, you are able to delete a group by inputting the name of your group. You will fail to do so if the group does not exists.

 7. addUserToGroup(): if you press 5, you will be able to add a user to a group by putting the name of that user also the name of group. If you fail to do so, you will be returned to the main menu.

 8. deleteUserFromGroup(): if you press 6, you will be able to delete a user from a group by putting the name of that user also the name of group. If you fail to do so, you will be returned to the main menu.

 9. listMembers(): if you press 7, you will be able to list all the members of a group by inputting the name of that group. If you fail to do so, you will be returned to the main menu.

 10. disconnect(): if you press 8, you will disconnect from the server, and the application will be shut down automatically.


 To start the File Server: java RunFileServer [(optional) port number]
 The file server will create a shared_files inside the working directory if one 
 does not exist. The file server is now online.  The file server will by default
 run on port 4321, but a custom port can be passed as the first command line
 argument.

 To reset the File server completely, delete FileList.bin and the shared_files 
 directory.
 To reset the Group Server, delete UserList.bin.
 
 Note that this implementation supports server side directories.
