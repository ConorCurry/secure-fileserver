      <h2>Overview</h2>
<!-- BEGIN CHANGES HERE -->

<p>In this section, broadly overview the types of cryptographic techniques that
your group has decided to use to address threats T1â€“T4.</p>

      <h2>Threat T1: Unauthorized Token Issuance</h2>
<!-- BEGIN CHANGES HERE -->

<p>A user needs to acquire a token to access the group server and the file server as well. However, it is not trustworthy that everyone who acquires the token is an authroized user. The system developed in phase 2 only needs a username to get a token from the group user, which is insesure because anyone can get that token as long as they know the username. If an adversary can know the username, he/she could access all the information related to that user stored on the group server and also all the files accessible to that username. As a result, the authentication of the user should be deployed before a token is issued. Also, the adversary can be a man in the middle, pretends to be the server and gets the messages passed from the user to the server, and then uses that information to pretend to be the user. Thus, it is also necessary for the system to authenticate the identify of the server during the process.</p>

<p>The proposed mechanisms are password mechanism. </p>

<p>Finally, provide a short argument addressing why your proposed mechanism
sufficiently addresses this particular threat. This argument should address the
correctness of your approach, as well as its overall security. For example, if
your mechanism involves a key agreement or key exchange protocol, you should
argue that both parties agree on the same key (correctnes) and that no other
party can figure out the key (security).</p>

      <h2>Discussion</h2>
<!-- BEGIN CHANGES HERE -->

<p>Conclude with a paragraph or two discussing the interplay between your
proposed mechanisms, and commenting on the design process that your group
followed. Did you discuss other ideas that didnâ€™t pan out before settling on the
above-documented approach? Did you end up designing a really interesting
protocol suite that addresses multiple threats at once? Use this space to show
off your hard work!</p>

<p>If your group did any extra credit, please discuss that in this section, as
well.</p>
