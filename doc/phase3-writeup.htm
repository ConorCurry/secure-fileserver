      <h2>Overview</h2>
<!-- BEGIN CHANGES HERE -->

<p>In this section, broadly overview the types of cryptographic techniques that
your group has decided to use to address threats T1â€“T4.</p>

<!-- END CHANGES HERE -->

    <section id="threat1">
      <h2>Threat T1: Unauthorized Token Issuance</h2>
<!-- BEGIN CHANGES HERE -->

<p>Begin this section by describing threat T1. This may include describing
examples of the threat being exploited by an adversary, a short discussion of
why this threat is problematic and needs to be addressed, and/or diagrams
showing how the threat might manifest in your groupâ€™s insecure
implementation.</p>

<p>Next, provide a short description of the mechanism that you chose to
implement to protect against this threat. For interactive protocols, it would be
helpful to provide a diagram explaining the messages exchanged between
participating principals (use html &lt;img&gt; tag to import such images). Be
sure to explain any cryptographic choices that your group makes: What types of
algorithms, modes of operation, and/or key lengths did you choose? Why? If
shared keys are needed, how are they exchanged?</p>

<p>Finally, provide a short argument addressing why your proposed mechanism
sufficiently addresses this particular threat. This argument should address the
correctness of your approach, as well as its overall security. For example, if
your mechanism involves a key agreement or key exchange protocol, you should
argue that both parties agree on the same key (correctnes) and that no other
party can figure out the key (security).</p>

      <h2>Threat T2: Token Modification/Forgery</h2>
<!-- BEGIN CHANGES HERE -->

<p>Repeat the steps as for Threat T1.</p>

    <section id="threat3">
      <h2>Threat T3: Unauthorized File Servers</h2>
<!-- BEGIN CHANGES HERE -->

<p>Repeat the steps as for Threat T1.</p>

<!-- END CHANGES HERE -->
    </section>
    <section id="threat4">
      <h2>Threat T4: Information Leakage via Passive Monitoring</h2>
<!-- BEGIN CHANGES HERE -->

<p>Repeat the steps as for Threat T1.</p>

<!-- END CHANGES HERE -->
    </section>
    <section id="discussion">
      <h2>Discussion</h2>
<!-- BEGIN CHANGES HERE -->

<p>Conclude with a paragraph or two discussing the interplay between your
proposed mechanisms, and commenting on the design process that your group
followed. Did you discuss other ideas that didnâ€™t pan out before settling on the
above-documented approach? Did you end up designing a really interesting
protocol suite that addresses multiple threats at once? Use this space to show
off your hard work!</p>

<p>If your group did any extra credit, please discuss that in this section, as
well.</p>
